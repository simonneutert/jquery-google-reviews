# jQuery Plugin to display Google Reviews of a Place on Google Maps

## I do not like jQuery!!!1eleven

The NPM Package is [here](https://github.com/simonneutert/google-maps-reviews) - Frontend Devs will know how to webpack :) or simply extract the code and adapt it to your needs, dropping jQuery as a dependency.

## Credits
Inspired by Steven Monson's magnificent article here:
https://www.launch2success.com/guide/display-google-reviews-website-2017/ or check out [Steven's github](https://github.com/stevenmonson/googleReviews). Steven's code is based on [peledies jquery plugin repo](https://github.com/peledies/google-places). So, I simply remixed their work into this repo. *Thank you guys!*

#### Dear beginners and copy-pasters

:octocat: *For those of you, who are new in programming or can only copy-paste, please make sure, that jQuery, the Google Maps API and the .js-file of this plugin are successfully loaded, before you call this script in your html page.*

*./demo/index.html is a working demo, the comments will guide you :wink:*

## Prerequisites

* You must have jQuery in your project: [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

* add the .js and .css of this repo to your project (see ./demo/index.html for inspiration :wink:)

* ___if you do not have a working Google Maps API key already:___ create a Google API Key: [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)

* add the following line with your  Google Maps API key with the key param:

  ``` html
  <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp&libraries=places&key=YourApiKeyHere"></script>
  ```

* add an empty ***div*** element in your html template with an unique ID, where the reviews should show up. In this case:

  `<div id="google-reviews"></div>`
  
## How to get link to “View All Google Reviews” or "Write a review"

* Step 1.  Open a browser, but don’t use Chrome.  You can use Firefox, or Edge, or even Internet Explorer but not Google Chrome because it alters the URL and your link will not work correctly.

* Step 2. Go to [Google.com](http://www.google.com) and search for your company’s name.

* Step 3. Find the card on the right and click “View All Google Reviews” or "Write a review"

* Step 4. Copy the URL in the address bar.

* Step 5. Now paste the URL as a link on `more_reviews_button_url` or `write_review_button_url` param.

## Call the Plugin

[Grab your place's ID (https://developers.google.com/places/place-id) and call it as ***placeId*** parameter, when calling the plugin. ](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id)

``` html
<script>
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
  if ($("#google-reviews").length == 0) {

  $("#google-reviews").googlePlaces({
